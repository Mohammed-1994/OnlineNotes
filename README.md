# OnlineNotes
This Android application helps to save notes in the server, retrieve and modify them.
The data is returned from the server in JSON format.
I used the following in this app.

- MySql Database server
- PHP scripts for create, update, read, delete the notes from the server.
- Retrofit2 Library for networking.
